                              <p>Sometimes a book manages to achieve its goals so well that it flies away from the earthly realm of meaning into a higher realm like a balloon that has slipped from the greasy hand of a child. Much like the metaphorical balloon Mark Danielewski’s <em>The Fifty Year Sword</em> explodes before our eyes as the author aims for loftier goals than rhyme and reason.</p>
                              <p>The structure and format of the book confused me. I felt I had to read the same sentences many times in order to get an idea of what was happening in the story. There is a story under all the confounding and grandstanding. A quite simple ghost story told with the five distinct but anonymous voices of the five orphans.</p>
                              <p>Five is a repeating theme in the book. There are five speakers, five orphans, five hinges on a box, five candles, five windows, and of course the eponymous fifty year sword is five multiplied by ten. This repetition and mystery is a part of a larger pattern of poetic and alienating use of language.</p>
                              <p>Danielewski tries to muddle the waters of traditional storytelling by narrating from the point of view of communal memory. The text is littered with portmanteaus, words made up by combining two or more words together. These creations amuse at times but usually make the reader groan from a sense of “was this really necessary”.</p>
                              <p>Was this necessary is a question I found myself asking often throughout the text. The sentences are usually cut up into smaller bits and divided between the five narrators. This creates a weird sort of flow to the text but makes understanding harder. The author naturally can’t help but break this rule in order to break the very structure he himself has implemented for the book.</p>
                              <p>After all of this questioning and criticism, I think the answer is yes. Yes, it was necessary for the book to be written in the way it was. The text sort of spits in the face of the reader from the getgo. This blatant disregard for convention and ease is worth the risk although it doesn’t always pay off. Ghost stories go back as far as ancient Rome. It’s a brave thing to reinvent something settled and such an endeavor can give other artists the spark as well.</p>
                              <p class="text-center">★★★☆☆</p>
                              <p class="text-center">An odd book for those who want to be challenged by their books.</p>
