                              <p>The chapters switch between the author addressing the reader directly and short stories. The stories are mentioned in the over-arching plot, which is constructed in the parts where the reader is talked to directly. This is the basic structure of Italo Calvino’s postmodernist <i>capolavoro</i>, or masterpiece, <i>If on a winter’s night a traveler</i>. Published 1979 in Italian and translated to English in 1981 by Willian Weaver. <i>If on a winter’s night a traveler</i> excels in the use of metanarratives.</p>
                              <p>The narrative complexity of this book was quite difficult for me to grasp at times. The metanarratives are baked into each other for the reader to wade through. Chiefly the complexity is built with metafictions which are about who the book is addressing. The very first words of the book Calvino sets the mood: “You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino’s new novel, ” (3). However, the “you” is not actually the person reading the book but a fictional character: “You’re the sort of person who, on principle, no longer expects anything of anything.” (Calvino 4).</p>
                              <p>From this point on Calvino continues to make suggestions and observations about “you”, making it clear that “you” is in fact a character. When Calvino writes “you noticed in a newspaper that If on a winter's night a traveler had appeared, the new book by Italo Calvino,” he doesn’t mean the book that we are actually reading but a metafictional version of the book (Calvino 4). In the same vein, the “Italo Calvino” mentioned is not the real person who wrote the real book but rather a fictional character.</p>
                              <p>For what purpose, you might ask, does Calvino construct a fictional “Italo Calvino” and a fictional “you”? The purpose is simple: so Calvino has the option of addressing the real reader later on as the real author. Because these characters are fictional, Calvino leaves room for the real Italo Calvino to address the real reader later in the book. This sort of chaotic layering of different meta-levels is exactly what makes people love and hate the book.</p>
                              <p>I won’t go into a detailed explanation of the structures found in the book but rather comment on the feelings and thoughts that this book evoked in me. The book sort of shocks the reader into redefining the idea of a book or a story. The way it starts then disrupts itself and finally descends into senseless hysterical plot lines. Or the playful and non-conforming use of language by Italo Calvino. The original Italian is more playful because of the language and how it sounds spoken out loud.</p>
                              <p><i>If on a winter’s night a traveler</i> is perhaps not the best book written, but after setting the book down, one is struck with the sense that the world of literature would be lessened if Calvino hadn’t written it. Without <i>If on a winter’s night a traveler</i> we wouldn’t get such insights:</p>

                                   <p class="mb-0">I'm producing too many stories at once because what I want is for you to feel, around 
                                        the story, a saturation of other stories that I could tell and maybe will tell or who 
                                        knows may already have told on some other occasion, a space full of stories that 
                                        perhaps is simply my lifetime, where you can move in all directions, as in space, always finding stories that cannot be told until other stories are told first, and so, setting out from any moment or place, you encounter always the same density of material to be told. (Calvino 97)
