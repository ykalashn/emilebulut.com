                              <p>My favorite fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin’s short story “The Author of the Acacia Seeds and Other Extracts from the Journal of the Association of Therolinguistics” showcases the narrative tool of multiperspectivity in the form of multiple narrators. Le Guin’s short story was published back in 1974 and still has the power to raise some interesting questions about the possibilities of narration.</p>
                              <p>The text of the story follows quite exactly what the title of the story promises to be; made up of three extracts from the “Journal of the Association of Therolinguistics” (Le Guin). No such journal exists but is rather the fictional source of the three parts that make up this short story. To answer why the author has chosen to use the guise of a scientific journal of all things for fiction we need to take a closer look at the text.</p>
                              <p>The first text is titled “MS. FOUND IN AN ANTHILL” and begins with the following “The messages were found written in a touch-gland exudation on degerminated acacia seeds laid in rows at the end of a narrow, erratic tunnel leading off from one of the deeper levels of the colony” (Le Guin). What follows is a detailed report and analysis of the messages left behind in the acacia seeds. The author, “a wingless neuter-female worker,” has left her last thoughts “in the solitude of a lonely tunnel” (Le Guin). Some of the ant author’s musings hit a timeless and universal theme such as “Long are the tunnels. Longer is the untunneled. No tunnel reaches the end of the untunneled” (Le Guin).</p>
                              <p>However, that’s just half of the story. Side-by-side with the seed messages is scientific commentary explaining the translations and possible interpretations of the messages. It’s exactly this side-by-side mode that creates the multi-narrative mode even within a story in a short story. We, the audience don’t only get to read the messages that the ant left behind for us but also the explanation from the people who translated the messages for us. The ant and the scientists are of course fictional creations of the real author, but by creating a fictional explanation of a fictional text we perhaps see some of the power behind the real author. This first story makes the reader aware of the choices a person who tells someone else’s story has to make. It also makes the reader think of the burden of interpreting messages. All of this is accomplished with the use of the multi-narrative mode.</p>
                              <p>The third and last extract titled “EDITORIAL BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE THEROLINGUISTICS ASSOCIATION” starts the legendary words “What is Language?” (Le Guin). After telling us that “Language is communication,” the president pivots to the more perplexing question of “What is Art?” (Le Guin). The President goes on to say that Tolstoy’s answer “Art, too, is communication. This answer has … been accepted without examination or criticism by therolinguistics.” (Le Guin). At this point, it’s useful to expand upon the meaning of the fictional science of therolinguistics. Thero means feral or beastly in Ancient Greek, whilst linguistics is the study of language. Thus, therolinguistics is the study of animal languages.</p>
                              <p>In the last part of the story, the President challenges the lack of study aimed at plant communication which stems from the belief that “plants do not communicate” (Le Guin). They write about the possibility that “the putative Art of the Plant is an <em>entirely different</em> from the Art of the Animal” (Le Guin). With these questions, the classical definition of a narrator is questioned since we usually don’t hear stories from the point of view of plants. It’s fascinating how Le Guin showcases the possibility of communication from plants and even rocks through the character of a president of a scientific association. They are a person that after a career of studying animal languages wants to encourage their peers to further push the limits of studying communication. I believe this is the sentiment of Le Guin as well; push the limits of storytelling and question who gets to be the narrator of stories.</p>
                              <p>I’ll end with the last words of the short story because Le Guin mesmerizingly describes the possibilities of communication beneath lichen: “read beneath it the still less communicative, still more passive, wholly atemporal, cold, volcanic poetry of the rocks: each one word spoken, how long ago, by the earth itself, in the immense solitude, the immense community, of space.”</p>
                              <p class="text-center">★★★★☆</p>
                              <p class="text-center">A fascinating short story showcasing the possibilities of multi-narration.</p>
