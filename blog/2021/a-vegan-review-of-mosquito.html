                              <p>Alex Lemon’s <em>Mosquito</em>, published in 2006, is a rough but rewarding collection of poetry. The author reflects on experiencing a life-threatening medical condition that upended his life. The poems are full of raw emotional power and innovative poetic expressions. Though the poems revolve around a subject unfamiliar to me, I still found them touching. Especially the poem “The Butcher Dreams” struck a chord with me as a vegan person.</p>
                              <p>I don’t know if Lemon meant the poem to have vegan undertones, but we cannot help but bring our own experience and perspective into the process when reading any piece of literature. Thus a poem lives a life on its own long after the author wrote it. “The Butcher Dreams” screams an introspective look at a human being faced with the brutality of animal cruelty.</p>
                              <p>The very title reminds us of the butcher’s existence, a symbol and scapegoat for humankind’s collective deeds towards animals. There are many ways to interpret the meaning of the title. It could mean a person dreams of being a butcher or the dreams of an actual butcher. It depends whether the word “butcher” in the title is the experiencing subject or simply part of the compound noun “butcher dreams”.</p>
                              <p>The dream’s content is revealed with brutal detail in the three stanzas, each made up of three lines of the poem. The first line sets the mood with a list of three: “Butcher paper, breasts, fresh snow.” (Lemon). The paper and breasts make sense and remind me of a scene in a butchery. It’s the inclusion of the “fresh snow” that breaks the illusion of the ordinary. I feel “fresh snow” to represent innocence which is juxtaposed to the dead chicken meat. This comparison underlines the brutality of the mundane and primes the reader for the rest of the poem.</p>
                              <p>The theme of violence is hinted at in the third line, “blade orange with rust.” (Lemon). The butcher must be so enamored with killing that he does not even have time to clean their blade, thus making it rust from the blood left on it. The “Heavy shadows ” mentioned by Lemon in the fifth line turn the poem’s attention to the butcher’s inner thinking. The shadows refer to meat hanging from hooks but also the shadows weighing on the butcher’s guilt. It’s the third and fourth stanzas Lemon’s words truly gripped me:</p>
                              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                <p>White aprons hungry for blood,<br>
                                    we used our weight to split<br>
                                    ribs, break bones.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Moans, the ripping of our saws.<br>
                                    We struggled, pink fingers,<br>
                                    pork against glass.
                                </p>
                              </blockquote>
                              <p>The whiteness of the aprons against the red blood creates a strong visual. I’m left feeling that the butchers want to sully themselves. Perhaps they find excitement from the dirty deed. Then the poem brutally describes the violent act of crushing the animals. It’s interesting how the butchered are not mentioned directly. They are reduced to objects for the butcher’s destruction.</p>
                              <p>And what about the mentioned struggle, which could be against exhaustion, guilt, or a particularly arduous butchering job. The “pink fingers” once again melds together the butcher’s experience and butchered by making it unclear which party is being described. Maybe we understand that a butcherer also harms some part of themselves when committing these violent acts.</p>
                              <p>The poem ends on a completely different note that harkens back to the name of the poem. Lemon writes of someone lying exhausted and their “Weary brain unfolding / like a lotus, intricate map of the heart.”. The reference to a map of the heart is surprising. Maybe by "I'd lie exhausted,"  Lemon means that the dreamer is trying to find his humanity after all that butchering. A map signals a search or journey. I understand this poem to suggest that the writer has to unfold and find the way back to being at one with their emotions.</p>
                              <p>This poem is simply one of many, but I think it shows the power Mosquito had over me. Poetry that inspires different kinds of interpretations has lasting power and is worth reading for all of us.</p>
                              <p class="text-center">★★★★☆</p>
                              <p class="text-center">A raw and emotional collection of poetry.</p>
