                              <p>Jon Krakauer’s <i>Into the Wild</i> recounts the non-fictional story of Chris McCandless and how he perished in the Alaskan wilderness after setting out to his “great Alaskan odyssey” (Krakauer). The book alternates between different tools of non-fiction writing such as describing, quoting, interviewing, reminiscing, and speculating.</p>
                              <p>The overall question and tension of the book arise from the need to judge Chris’ actions one way or the other. Some see him as a heroic figure to be emulated while others as a foolhardy idiot to be admonished for bringing pain to the people close to him. Krakauer seems to view Chris with a mix of awe and understanding, and describes him as a “pilgrim” and likening him to a “monk”.</p>
                              <p>Krakauer muddles traditional notions of a narrative and story by mixing up his own story and thought into the story and thought of Chris and various writers, who he quotes and who Chris quoted during his travels. Thus, the author knits the themes and ideas of Chris’ story -as he sees it- together. The links between the author and the subject are further muddled by the fact that Krakauer emulates Chris’ track in order to interview people and see the places Chris visited.</p>
                              <p>Furthermore, Krakauer compares Chris to other “adventurers” who perished or disappeared in the wilderness, and further to the authors that Chris quotes namely Henry David Thoreau, Jack London, and Leo Tolstoy. These comparisons are meant as a sort of background which helps us see the actions and thoughts of Chris in a more clear light. Much of the book is speculation and thought about the musings and motivations of Chris, who based on all available material was an intense and morally focused individual seeking some kind of enlightenment through going into the wild.</p>
                              <p>The structure of the book is a sort of spiral that circles around the center point of Chris’s death. We examine Chris’ life through different lenses without arriving at many concrete conclusions. All throughout the book Chris’ life is also reflected back upon the reader as a mirror to reflect your own life. The pondering and meandering style of the book suits the somber topic well and creates a surprisingly effective whole.</p>
                              <p>Overall the book offers the reader a chance for a profound read that can help us to stop and think about the things we focus on in our own lives. In the words of Chris McCandless: “HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED”.</p>
                              <p class="text-center">★★★★★</p>
                              <p class="text-center">Timeless non-fiction about the search for meaning in our modern world.</p>
