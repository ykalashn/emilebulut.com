                              <p>Robert A. Heinlein’s “ '—All You Zombies—' ” is a masterpiece of time travel science fiction. Though raw and rough around the edges, the story manages to instill the paradox and perfection of time travel into a coherent form. It’s challenging to write about this story without spoiling the central idea of the plot, so I will inform you when we get to the part where I discuss the story’s major revelation. I recommend you to read the short story first and then read my review, but I have a spoiler warning before going into the details.</p>
                              <p>The style of the story is free-flowing and unconventional. Heinlein breaks sentences into odd parts by moving the rest of the sentence to the following line. Double dashes are applied throughout the text liberally, and quotation marks usually only exist at the beginning of dialogue. The dialogue is not quite how people speak in real life, but at the same time, it has a feel of being hyper-real; somehow, the dialogue feels more real than what we know to be real. A striking example of Heinlein’s dialogue style: “-- I'd say, "Get those goddam reindeer off / my roof! " Shove it, Pop - there's no such job. --”.</p>
                              <p>Heinlein wrote the story in one day, and the quick writing does show. However, the idea of the story is so perfect that no amount of roughness can deduct from it. Heinlein describes a wedding ring worn by the main character as “-- The Worm Ouroboros ... the World Snake that eats its own tail, forever without end. A symbol of the Great Paradox. --”. This reference to the Ouroboros encapsulates the theme and story: a circle made whole and beginnings through ends. These are the paradoxes of time travel stories, and Heinlein embraces them rather than shying away.</p>
                              <p>Be warned: spoilers follow in the next paragraph.</p>
                              <p>The central premise of the story is the paradox of the main character’s existence. Through time travel, the main character, Jane, has become their mother and father. Thus, creating a perfect circle of existence which the main character has to maintain. Jane has to go into the past to make their past self take part in the continuation of the cycle and recruit themselves into “The Temporal Bureau” (Heinlein). The exact moment when the future Jane confronts the past Jane about the fact of their origin: “"Me. Now you know who he is - and after you think it / over you'll know who you are... and if you think hard enough, / you'll figure out who the baby is... and who I am. --” (Heinlein).</p>
                              <p>After this paradox is shown to the reader, the story becomes a sort of puzzle which starts to make sense in a new way. Re-reading the past becomes a unique experience because the past events are just future events from a different point of view.</p>
                              <p>After marveling at this self-contained existence, the most exciting part becomes the feelings and thoughts of Jane after living such a life. Jane muses that “A Cesarian leaves big scar,” which reflects the emotional scars that “thirty subjective-years of time-jumping” have left on them (Heinlein). Jane reflects on the different people they have been in their life up to that point: “I / know where I came from - but where did all you zombies come / from ?” (Heinlein). The zombies are the memories of the people she has been. The memories that follow her like the walking dead. Even though she calls the memories zombies, Heinlein finished the story with Jane thinking: “I miss you dreadfully!”.</p>
