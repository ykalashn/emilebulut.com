                              <p>William S. Burroughs’ attacks language with experimental narrative tactics in “Johnny 23”, published in 1973 in the short story collection <em>Exterminator!</em>. The string of words that is this short story form a stream of consciousness, which challenged me to rethink the very experience of reading. The story itself tells of a doctor who is “disturbed” by other people and decides to spread a “beautiful disease” that will make “the world a fit place for him to live.”</p>
                              <p>Burroughs’ famous quip of “Language is a virus from outer space” influenced my understanding of the text, which I saw as a parallel of that very concept. I felt the text distance me from language, narration and ultimately destroy the very medium of writing itself.</p>
                              <p>Burroughs reaches this destruction by employing several tactics. First of all, Burroughs doesn’t capitalize the beginnings of sentences. He only uses capital letters for the names, such as Doctor John Lee, who I saw representing the author himself. Periods are even rarer and only punctuate the first and last sentence of the story. In all other instances, Burroughs separates sentences with ellipses, which supports the stream of consciousness feel.</p>
                              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                <p class="mb-0">“… near him we now see several convulsed forms, the closest a few feet away outstretched hand clutching a handful of grass … the camera pans out convulsed corpses to the sky back to the man sitting there on his cane seat …”</p>
                                <span class="blockquote-footer">Burroughs</span>
                              </blockquote>
                              <p>The above passage from the text reveals more of Burroughs’ tactics. With the use of “we now see” Burroughs co-opts the reader into an experiencing subject within the story. Thus breaking the fourth wall makes the reader more aware of their role as the story’s interpreter.</p>
                              <p>Referencing “the camera pans out” is also an off-putting choice because it reminds me of reading a film director’s dictations. My classmates have told me that my prose has a cinematic feel, which doesn’t surprise me because I think of stories visually. However, I have never written about a camera panning out in a short story because that would be like writing (read this part slower) after a vital part of a story. It is simply not done, and by doing it here, Burroughs continues his relentless attack on language.</p>
                              <p>“Johnny 23” is the name that the main character gives to the cure that will “remove from the planet hostile alien forces manifesting themselves through other people.” This infection has made them unbearable to our author/main character Lee who cures them by converting them to “the human condition.” Doctor Lee does not mean “Johnny 23” to kill all humans but rather make the world peaceful “by turning everyone into himself.” However, due to a “miscalculation,” everyone but the Doctor ends up dead.</p>
                              <p>I understand this to mean that for language—the unrealness of human communication—to die, people must accept their mortality. Perhaps the author sees the corrupting fear of death as a parallel to language, which also tries to outlive individual human beings. Then by destroying language, the author liberates us, the readers, like how Doctor John Lee cures other humans with “Johnny 23”. Thus, for humans to be free, language must die.</p>
                              <p class="text-center">★★★★☆</p>
                              <p class="text-center">A must-read for those who seek the limits of language.</p>
