                              <p>William Faulkner’s short story “A Rose for Emily,” published in 1930, uses many elements of fiction to create a sense of nostalgia. The story doesn’t just create a feeling of nostalgia but also explores the pitfalls of pining for lost things and not letting go. The titular character Emily is the central figure of this exploration as she is the embodiment of being stuck in the past.</p>
                              <p>The story alternates between two modes of narration. Sometimes Faulkner writes in the first person plural as in “We did not say she was crazy then. We believed she had to do that.” These passages are spoken from the present moment and tell of the current state of things and the past. But at other times, the narration shifts to a third-person omniscient point of view, which allows the narrator to investigate the events of the past in a more detailed and individual manner by diving into the actions and dialogue of particular people.</p>
                              <p>The presence of the first person plural point of view is by its very nature a nostalgic choice by the author. Speaking of events in the first person plural creates a sense of community, memory, legend, and shared experience. The shared experience is exactly what allows events to build a shroud of nostalgia around themselves. The shifts into third-person narration support the communal feel because the reader feels as if the communal storyteller is pretending to be individual people from the past to tell their stories.</p>
                              <p>Faulkner describes Emily as “a small, fat woman in black, with a thin gold chain descending to her waist and vanishing into her belt, leaning on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head. Her skeleton was small and spare; perhaps that was why what would have been merely plumpness in another was obesity in her. She looked bloated, like a body long submerged in motionless water, and of that pallid hue.” Her very looks remind the reader of a corpse or a dying thing.</p>
                              <p>How is it that Emily ends up being a living relic occupying “a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies, set on what had once been our most select street.” (Faulkner)? The reason lies in Emily’s upbringing, namely in her father’s banishment of all romantic possibilities from her life. This absence of romance leads Emily to murder the first man that she has some kind of a relationship. The murdered man is then laid in her bed, where he stays for years besides her.</p>
                              <p>Emily is brought up to believe that she’s part of “the high and mighty Griersons” (Faulkner). Her view of her family’s status as better than others, combined with her lack of a romantic life, twists Emily into the woman she eventually becomes. In the past, Emily and her father are described as “Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.” (Faulkner). She grows up to be a woman who cannot let things go or move on. This is shown when she refuses to accept her father’s death, pay taxes to the town, and ultimately poison Homer Barron rather than let him leave her.</p>
                              <p>Emily and the story can also be interpreted as a reflection of the nostalgia and sense of loss present in the south at the beginning of the 20th century. The culture of the old south and the Confederacy is brought up numerous times in the story. It’s precisely these feelings that create the perfect setting for a story about Emily. It also shows the reader how nostalgia can be dangerous on a larger scale when people pine for lost days full of issues like racism, misogyny, and classism.</p>
