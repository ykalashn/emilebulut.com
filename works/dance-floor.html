                          <p>INT. DANCE HALL - DAY</p>
                          <p>A shining new dance floor in a 50's style dance hall. Rock n roll music played by a live band in the background.</p>
                          <p>A group of young men approach three young women sitting in the side of the dance hall. BILLY, one of the men in a checkered suit, offers his hand to SAMMY, one of the women in a yellow dress, sitting in the middle. Sammy accepts Billy's hand, and Billy leads her to the dance floor.</p>
                          <p>Billy and Sammy dance a rockabilly style dance on the dance floor. Other dancers form a circle around them and clap their hands.</p>
                          <br>
                          <p>INT. DANCE HALL - DAY</p>
                          <p>A group of students singing 60's protest songs in the dance hall. Many of the students are holding placards and some are smoking joints.
                         </p>
                         <p>The singing students march out of the dance hall. The dance hall is empty and dark.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT</p>
                         <p>The dance hall is filled with students, many of whom are injured. There are candles lighting the hall.</p>
                         <p>CLAIRE, a long haired woman in a flowing dress, walks the injured students tending to them.</p>
                         <p>Someone starts to sing a folk ballad, others join and starts to play their guitar.
                         </p>
                         <br>
                         <p>INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT</p>
                         <p>The dance hall has been refurbished into a disco with flashing colors and shining surfaces.</p>
                         <p>A crowd of people start dancing as the DJ, a black man with an afro and a bushy beard, puts on 70's disco music.</p>
                         <p>TRIX, a Latina drag queen in sequence, enters the dance floor and starts to dance. The other dancers cheer her on and Trix starts to strip down as she dances.</p>
                         <p>The doors to the dance hall crash open and police officers enter. They start arresting people.</p>
                         <p>The dancers are running around in a panic, screaming and some are struggling against the police.</p>
                         <p>Trix tries to pull her dress up, but a police officer tackles her to the floor. Her head starts to bleed, and the blood spreads on the floor.
                         </p>
                         <p>The disco music stops.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>INT. DANCE HALL - DAY</p>
                         <p>The dance hall is dusty and dirty. There's a broken disco ball on the floor.</p>
                         <p>The door to the dance hall opens and a group of young people in streetwear look in. JONES, a young man in a black hoodie, steps in.
                         </p>
                         <p class="character">JONES</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">The hell happened here?</p>
                         <p>ROSE, a young woman with dark makeup, steps in after Jones.</p>
                         <p class="character">ROSE</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Ever heard of disco?</p>
                         <p class="character">JONES</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Sure. I heard it's dead. Come on guys. Let's make this happen.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT</p>
                         <p>The dance hall is lit up by lasers and a projection of two people dancing upside down on the wall. 80's rave music is playing.
                         </p>
                         <p>Jones and Rose are dancing together, surrounded by other ravers dancing. The song changes and a cheer goes through the crowd. Rose wraps her arms around Jones and kisses him.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT</p>
                         <p>The dance hall has more flashing lights and some smoke floating in the air. 90's techno is playing.</p>
                         <p>Jones looks at a pill labeled 'E' in his hands and swallows it.
                         </p>
                         <p>Rose walks next to Jones. He tries to make her dance with her. Rose resists him and looks annoyed. Jones kisses Rose. She pushes him away and walks out of the dance hall.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>INT. DANCE HALL - DAY</p>
                         <p>The dance hall has been cleaned up and the techno stuff is gone. There are benches on the sides and a large CD player on one of them. The hall has eight kids in front of a woman.</p>
                         <p>ALICE, a middle aged woman with a high hair bun, presses the play button on the CD player. Modern hip hop music starts to play.
                         </p>
                         <p class="character">ALICE</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Okay kids. Repeat after me.</p>
                         <p>Alice does two dance moves and the kids repeat after her with varying success. One of the kids breaks through a floorboard with their leg and starts screaming in pain.</p>
                         <p class="character">ALICE</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Oh my god!</p>
                         <p>Alice runs to the kid and helps pull his bleeding leg out of the floor.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>INT. DANCE HALL - DAY</p>
                         <p>A group of queer people from different ages are staring at the hole in the dance floor.</p>
                         <p>Rose, now in her forties, enters the dance hall.</p>
                         <p class="character">ROSE</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Sorry I’m late. What’s that?</p>
                         <p>SAM, a young man in a wheelchair, wheels over to Rose.</p>
                         <p class="character">SAM</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">It's why they closed down. This place must be ancient by now. Just look at those floorboards.</p>
                         <p class="character">ROSE</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Yeah, it looked better. But we got for a bargain. Now we just gotta fix it up.</p>
                         <p>MONTAGE</p>
                         <p>-The queer people are taking out the broken floorboards with the help of butch looking women carpenters.
                         </p>
                         <p>-Sam carries a bunch of new floorboards on top of his wheelchair and hands them to the people working.</p>
                         <p>-Rose points at places and tells some young people about the history of the dance hall.</p>
                         <p>-The new floorboards are sanded and polished to look new.</p>
                         <p>-The dance hall is decorated with rainbows.</p>
                         <p>BACK TO SCENE</p>
                         <p>Rose, Sam and the others are standing at the doors and looking at the rebuilt dance hall.</p>
                         <p class="character">ROSE</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Damn.</p>
                         <p class="character">SAM</p>
                         <p class="dialogue">Time to let the people in.</p>
                         <p>Rose opens the doors to the dance hall and more people from all backgrounds enter.</p>
                         <p>A DJ puts on music like rock, folk music, disco, techno and contemporary queer music. The people in the dance hall dance and enjoy themselves to the music.</p>
                         <p class="the-end">THE END</p>
